<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This is the privacy policy of SJA in Numbers, run by Tony Richards ('we', 'our', 'us').</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>
    This notice describes how we collect, store, transfer and use personal data. It tells you about
    your privacy rights and how the law protects you.
</p>
<p>
    In the context of the law and this notice, ‘personal data’ is information that clearly identifies
    you as an individual or which could be used to identify you if combined with other information.
    Acting in any way on personal data is referred to as ‘processing’.
</p>
<p>
    This notice applies to personal data collected through our website and through social media
    platforms and online retail platforms.
</p>
<p>
    Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information
    collected through our website.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions about how we process your personal data, including any requests to
    exercise your legal rights, please contact Tony Richards at <a href="mailto:@DataProtectionEmail">@DataProtectionEmail</a>.
</p>

<h3>2. Personal Data We Process</h3>

<h4>2.1 How We Obtain Personal Data</h4>

<p>
    This information we process about you includes information:
    <ul>
        <li>You have directly provided to use</li>
        <li>That is gathered by monitoring how you use our website or our services</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>2.2 Types of Personal Data We Collect Directly</h4>
<p>
    When you use our website, for example when you create an account, we ask you to provide
    personal data.  This can be categorised into the following groups:
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identifiers such as your name</li>
        <li>Contact information, such as your email address</li>
        <li>Account information, including a username and password</li>
        <li>
            Records of communication between us, including messages sent through
            our website or by email
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>2.3 Types of Personal Data We Collect From Your Use Of Our Services</h4>
<p>
    By using our website, we process:
    <ul>
        <li>Your username, password, and other information used to access our website</li>
        <li>
            Technical information about the hardware and the software you use to access
            our website and use our services, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address,
            your browser type and version and your device’s operating system
        </li>
        <li>
            Usage information, including the frequency you use our services, the pages of
            our website that you visit, whether you receive messages from us and whether
            you reply to those messages
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>2.4 Our Use Of Aggregated Information</h4>
<p>
    We may aggregate anonymous information such as statistical or demographic data for any
    purpose.  Anonymous information is that which does not identify you as an individual.
    Aggregated information may be derived from your personal data but is not considered as
    such in law because it does not reveal your identity.  For example, we may aggregate
    usage information to assess whether a feature of our website is useful.
</p>
<p>
    However, if we combine or connect aggregated information with your personal data so that
    we can identify you in any way, we treat the combined information as personal data, and it
    will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.
</p>

<h4>2.5 Special Personal Data</h4>
<p>
    Special personal data is data about your race, ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs,
    sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, health, genetic and
    biometric data.  We do not collect any special personal data about you.
</p>

<h4>
    2.6 If You Do Not Provide Personal Data We Need
</h4>
<p>
    If you fail to provide your email address, a name or a password, you will not be able to use this
    website as you will not be able to create an account.
</p>

<h3>3. The Basis On Which We Process Your Data</h3>
<p>
    The law requires us to determine under which legal basis we process your personal data, and
    notify you of these.  If a basis is no longer relevant, we shall stop processing your data, or
    if relevant we will notify you of the new basis under which we process your data.
</p>
<h4>3.1 Information We Process Because We Have A Contractual Obligation With You</h4>
<p>
    When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree
    to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.
</p>
<p>
    In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us.
    Some of this information may be personal data.
</p>
<p>
    We may use it in order to:
    <ul>
        <li>Verify your identity for security purposes when you use our services</li>
        <li>Provide you with our services</li>
        <li>
            Provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services
            and how to obtain the most from using our website
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that
    you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.
</p>
<p>
    We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends
    or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.
</p>
<h4>3.2 Information We Process With Your Consent</h4>
<p>
    Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as
    when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, you
    provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal data.
</p>
<p>
    Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example,
    we ask you to agree to our use of non-essential cookies when you access our website.
</p>
<p>
    We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can
    be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.
</p>
<p>
    You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at
    <a href="mailto:@DataProtectionEmail">@DataProtectionEmail</a>. However,
    if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.
</p>
<p>
    We aim to obtain and keep your consent to process your information. However, while we take your
    consent into account in decisions about whether or not to process your personal data, the withdrawal
    of your consent does not necessarily prevent us from continuing to process it. The law may allow us
    to continue to process your personal data, provided that there is another basis on which we may do
    so. For example, we may have a legal obligation to do so.
</p>
<h4>3.3 Information We Process For The Purposes of Legitimate Interests</h4>
<p>
    We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us,
    of doing so.
</p>
<p>
    Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:
    <ul>
        <li>Whether the same objective could be achieved through other means</li>
        <li>Whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm</li>
        <li>
            Whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round,
            consider it reasonable to do so
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:
    <ul>
        <li>Improving our services</li>
        <li>Record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business</li>
        <li>
            Responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect
            a response
        </li>
        <li>Preventing fraudulent use of our services</li>
        <li>
            Exercising our legal rights, including to detect and prevent fraud and to protect our
            intellectual property
        </li>
        <li>Protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>3.4 Information We Process Because We Have A Legal Obligation</h4>
<p>    Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.</p>
<p>
    For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request
    or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.
</p>
<p>This may include your personal data.</p>

<h3>6. Use Of Information We Collect Through Automated Systems</h3>
<h4>6.1 Cookies</h4>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by your web browser when you visit a website that uses them. They allow information gathered on one web page to be stored until it is needed for use at a later date.</p>
<p>They are commonly used to provide you with a personalised experience while you browse a website, for example, allowing your preferences to be remembered.</p>
<p>They can also provide core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility; record how you interact with the website so that the owner can understand how to improve the experience of other visitors; and serve you advertisements that are relevant to your browsing history.</p>
<p>Some cookies may last for a defined period of time, such as one visit (known as a session), one day or until you close your browser. Others last indefinitely until you delete them.</p>
<p>Your web browser should allow you to delete any cookie you choose. It should also allow you to prevent or limit their use. Your web browser may support a plug-in or add-on that helps you manage which cookies you wish to allow to operate. </p>
<p>The law requires you to give explicit consent for use of any cookies that are not strictly necessary for the operation of a website.</p>
<p>When you first visit our website, we ask you whether you wish us to use cookies. If you choose not to accept them, we shall not use them for your visit except to record that you have not consented to their use for any other purpose.</p>
<p>If you choose not to use cookies or you prevent their use through your browser settings, you may not be able to use all the functionality of our website.</p>

    your IP address. We also record information about the software you are using to browse our website,
    such as the type of computer or device and the screen resolution.
</p>
<p>
    We use this information in aggregate to assess the popularity of the webpages on our website and
    how we perform in providing content to you.
</p>
<p>
    If combined with other information we know about you from previous visits, the data possibly could
    be used to identify you personally, even if you are not signed in to our website.
</p>
<h3>7. Other Matters</h3>
<h4>7.1 Your Rights</h4>
<p>
    The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regard to the
    processing and control of your personal data.
</p>
<p>
    We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at
    <a href="https://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org">https://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org</a>.
</p>
<h4>7.2 Use Of Our Services By Children</h4>
<p>
    We do not sell products or provide services for purchase by children, nor do we market to
    children.  It is against our terms or service for children to use this website.
</p>
<h4>7.3 Encryption Of Data Sent Between Us</h4>
<p>
    We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to verify our identity to your browser and
    to encrypt any data you give us.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever information is transferred between us, you can check that it is done so using SSL
    by looking for a closed padlock symbol or other trust mark in your browser’s URL bar or toolbar.
</p>
<h4>7.4 Delivery Of Services Using Third Party Communication Software</h4>
<p>
    With your consent, we may communicate using software provided by a third party such as Facebook
    (WhatsApp) or Microsoft (Teams).
</p>
<p>
    Such methods of communication should secure your personal data using encryption and other
    technologies. The providers of such software should comply with all applicable privacy laws,
    rules, and regulations, including the GDPR.
</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about using a particular software for communication, please tell us.</p>
<h4>7.5 Data Processed Outside the UK</h4>
<p>Our website is hosted in the United Kingdom.  We do not process data outside of the UK.</p>
<h4>7.6 Control Over Your Own Information</h4>
<p>
    It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and up to date. Please
    inform us if your personal data changes.
</p>
<p>
    At any time, you may contact us to request that we provide you with the personal data we hold
    about you.
</p>
<p>
    All of the personal information we have about you is sourced from Microsoft Entra.  You can
    access this at any time and update it by logging into your Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
    To obtain a copy of any information that is not provided on our website you should contact us to
    make that request.
</p>
<p>
    When we receive any request to access, edit or delete personal data we first take reasonable steps
    to verify your identity before granting you access or otherwise taking any action. This is important
    to safeguard your information.
</p>
<p>
    Please be aware that we are not obliged by law to provide you with all personal data we hold about
    you, and that if we do provide you with information, the law allows us to charge for such provision
    if doing so incurs costs for us. After receiving your request, we will tell you when we expect to
    provide you with the information, and whether we require any fee for providing it to you.
</p>
<p>
    If you wish us to remove personally identifiable information from our website, you should contact
    us to make your request.
</p>
<p>This may limit the service we can provide to you.</p>
<p>
    We remind you that we are not obliged by law to delete your personal data or to stop processing
    it simply because you do not consent to us doing so. While having your consent is an important
    consideration as to whether to process it, if there is another legitimate basis on which we may
    process it, we may do so on that basis.
</p>
<h4>7.7 Communicating With Us</h4>
<p>
    When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website or by email, we collect the data
    you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need.
</p>
<p>We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our business.</p>
<p>
    We may keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your
    name and email address so as to be able to track our communications with you to provide a
    high quality service.
</p>
<h3>8. Complaints</h3>
<p>
    If you are not happy with our privacy policy, or if you have any complaint, then you should tell us.
</p>
<p>
    When we receive a complaint, we record the information you have given to us on the basis of consent.
    We use that information to resolve your complaint.
</p>
<p>
    If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you
    about it.
</p>
<p>
    If your complaint reasonably requires us to notify some other person, we may decide to give to
    that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently
    as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion whether we do give information, and if we
    do, what that information is.
</p>
<p>
    We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level
    of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.
</p>
<p>
    If a dispute is not settled then we hope you will agree to attempt to resolve it by engaging in
    good faith with us in a process of mediation or arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    If you are in any way dissatisfied about how we process your personal data, you have a right to
    lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). This can be done at
    <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/">https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/</a>. We would,
    however, appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about your concern before you approach the ICO.
</p>
<h3>9. Retention Period</h3>
<p>
    Except as otherwise mentioned in this privacy notice, we keep your personal data only for as
    long as required by us:
    <ul>
        <li>To provide you with the services you have requested</li>
        <li>To comply with other law, including for the period demanded by our tax authorities</li>
        <li>To support a claim or defence in court</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>10. Compliance With The Law</h3>
<p>
    Our privacy policy complies with the law in the United Kingdom, specifically with the Data
    Protection Act 2018 (the ‘Act’) accordingly incorporating the EU General Data Protection
    Regulation (‘GDPR’) and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (‘PECR’).
</p>
<h3>11. Review Of This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We shall update this privacy notice from time to time as necessary.</p>
